# 🚀 My Ultimate Excel MCP Server ⚡️

> **Hello! I'm the developer behind this project, and I built this because I believe we can do better than traditional spreadsheets.**

I've always felt that for all their power, spreadsheets were fundamentally disconnected from the way we think. We ask questions; spreadsheets demand rigid formulas.

So, I decided to build the tool I always wanted: **a data powerhouse that lets you talk to your data**. This server transforms Claude into an AI data scientist, backed by a complete, from-scratch Excel formula engine and a suite of advanced analytics tools.

This isn't just another Excel plugin. It's my vision for the future of data analysis—intelligent, intuitive, and incredibly powerful.

## ✨ What Makes This Project Special?

This server is built on three core pillars that I personally designed and coded:

### 🧠 **A True AI-Native Interface**
Don't just `read_file`. **Have a conversation.** Ask "What were our total sales in Q4?" or "Find the top 5 employees by performance score" and get immediate, actionable answers.

- **"Sum all sales in January"** → `=SUMIFS(B:B, A:A, ">=1/1/2024", A:A, "<=1/31/2024")`
- **"Find duplicates in customer data"** → Instant duplicate detection
- **"Create a forecast model"** → Automated predictive analytics
- **"Clean messy phone numbers"** → Smart data standardization

### ⚡ **A Full-Featured Excel Formula Engine (Built from Scratch!)**
I wrote a complete formula language implementation, including a tokenizer, a parser that generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and an evaluator. It supports over 200 functions, complex nesting, and proper operator precedence—all custom-built.

- **200+ Excel functions** implemented from scratch
- **Real-time formula evaluation** with dependency tracking
- **Error detection & auto-fixing** for formula debugging
- **Circular reference detection** and resolution
- **Array formulas** and dynamic calculations

### 🔌 **A Resilient, Multi-Provider AI Backbone**
The system intelligently uses the best AI for the job, with automatic fallbacks. It seamlessly switches between providers like Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, and Gemini, and even includes an offline-first local provider so it's never truly "down."

### 📊 **Advanced Data Science Suite**
🎯 **Smart Data Access** - Get any cell, range, or entire sheets  
🔍 **Intelligent Search** - Find data with fuzzy or exact matching  
📊 **Built-in Analytics** - SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX operations  
🔧 **Advanced Filtering** - Query data with conditions  
⚡ **Lightning Fast** - Optimized for large datasets  
📈 **Multi-format** - CSV, XLSX, XLS support  
💾 **Write & Export** - Create new files and export analysis results  
📊 **Statistical Analysis** - Comprehensive stats, correlations, profiling  
🤖 **Machine Learning** - Clustering, classification, predictions  
📈 **Time Series Analysis** - Forecasting and trend detection  

## 🔧 Getting Started: Your 3-Step Setup

Let's get you up and running in minutes.

### Step 1: Clone & Install
First, grab the code and install the necessary packages.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/ishayoyo/excel-mcp.git

# 2. Navigate into the project directory
cd excel-mcp

# 3. Install all the dependencies
npm install

# 4. Build the project (compiles the TypeScript to JavaScript)
npm run build
```

### Setup with Claude Desktop

**Basic Setup (Local AI only):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "excel-csv": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\path\\to\\excel-mcp\\dist\\index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**🤖 With AI Providers (Two Options):**

**Option A: Using .env file (Recommended)**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "excel-csv": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\path\\to\\excel-mcp\\dist\\index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```
*Then create a .env file in your project directory with your API keys (see Step 2 below).*

**Option B: Direct configuration**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "excel-csv": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\path\\to\\excel-mcp\\dist\\index.js"],
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "your-anthropic-key",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your-openai-key",
        "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY": "your-deepseek-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```


### Step 2: Configure Your AI Providers (The Fun Part!)
This server is at its best when connected to an AI. All you need is an API key.

**Get an API Key:** Choose your favorite provider (or get multiple for maximum power!).

| Provider | Best For | Cost | Get API Key |
|----------|----------|------|-------------|
| 🧠 Anthropic Claude | Complex reasoning | $$$ | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |
| ⚡ OpenAI GPT | Fast responses | $$ | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) |
| 💰 DeepSeek | Amazing value | $ | [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com) |
| 🌟 Google Gemini | Multimodal tasks | $$ | [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) |
| 🔧 Local Fallback | Always works! | Free | No key needed! |

**Create Your .env File:**  
I've included an example file to make this easy. Just copy it.

```bash
# This command copies the example to your personal .env file
cp .env.example .env
```

**Add Your Keys:**  
Now, open the new .env file in your favorite editor and paste in your API key(s).

**📝 Example .env file:**
```env
# --- Paste your API keys below ---
# You only need one, but you can add more for fallbacks!

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
GEMINI_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Optional: You can also specify which model to use
# ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
# OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o
```

🔒 **Security Note**: Your .env file is where you store your secret keys. I've already added it to .gitignore, so you'll never accidentally commit your keys to a public repository.

### Step 3: Connect to Claude
You can connect this server to any MCP-compatible client, like Claude Desktop or Claude Code (in VS Code).

**For Claude Desktop:**  
Open your Claude Desktop configuration file.
Add the following snippet under mcpServers. Make sure to replace the args path with the absolute path to the dist/index.js file in this project.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "excel-csv": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\YourUser\\path\\to\\excel-csv-mcp-server\\dist\\index.js"],
      "env": {
         // You can also put keys here, but the .env file is recommended!
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For Claude Code (VS Code / WSL):**  
The easiest way is to install it globally so you can access it from any project.

```bash
# Run this from the project directory
npm install -g .
```

Now, when Claude Code asks for your MCP server configuration, you can use npx:
- Command: `npx`
- Args: `-y excel-csv-mcp`

The server will automatically detect the .env file in your project directory.

## 💡 Talk to Your Data: Usage Examples

Once connected, you can perform powerful data operations using natural language.

### 🗣️ Basic Data Exploration
```

✅ The server will use the data_profile tool to give you a complete overview of every column.

🗣️ "What's the total revenue from the 'Electronics' category?"
✅ The server can combine filter_rows and aggregate to get the answer instantly.

🗣️ "What's in cell B5?"
✅ Instant cell lookup with context understanding.
```

### 🧠 AI-Powered Formula Generation
```
🗣️ "Generate a formula to sum all sales in Q4."
✅ My custom AI-powered formula generator will intelligently produce a formula like 
    =SUMIFS(C:C, B:B, ">=10/1/2024", B:B, "<=12/31/2024").

🗣️ "Sum all sales where region is 'North'"
✅ =SUMIF(B:B, "North", C:C)

🗣️ "Calculate average of last 30 days"
✅ =AVERAGEIFS(A:A, B:B, ">="&TODAY()-30)

🗣️ "Count unique customers this month"

```

### 💾 Export & Reporting
```
🗣️ "Create a pivot table showing average salary by department from employee_data.csv 
     and export it to salary_report.xlsx."
✅ The server will run the pivot_table analysis and then use the export_analysis tool 
    to create a new, perfectly formatted Excel file for you.

🗣️ "Export the pivot table results to department_summary.xlsx"
🗣️ "Save the statistical analysis to salary_stats.csv"
🗣️ "Generate automated reports with charts"
```

**🎉 Making Excel obsolete, one formula at a time!**

This isn't just another tool—it's my vision for the future of data analysis. We don't need to settle for rigid formulas when we can have conversations with our data. We don't need to memorize function syntax when AI can understand what we want to accomplish.

I built this because I believe data analysis should be as natural as asking a question. And with this server, it finally is.

*Built with ❤️ for the Claude ecosystem*
